![IT](https://github.com/Gaurav130421/IT-Ticket-Analysis/blob/main/IT%20Ticket%20analysis.png)


## 📊 Overview

This project involves the analysis of IT support tickets using **Power BI**. The goal is to monitor key service metrics, identify bottlenecks, and optimize the efficiency of the IT helpdesk operations through interactive visual dashboards.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze trends in ticket volume, status, and resolution time
- Track SLA compliance and priority-based resolution
- Monitor agent performance and backlog issues
- Enable leadership to make informed decisions through data

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation, DAX, data modeling
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Measures & KPIs

| Priority            | Low, Medium, High, Urgent               |
| Assigned Agent      | The support staff handling the ticket   |
| Created Date        | When the ticket was logged              |
| Resolved Date       | When the issue was marked as resolved   |
| SLA Met             | Whether the ticket met SLA or not       |
| Department          | Business unit requesting support        |
| Resolution Time (hrs)| Time taken to resolve the ticket       |

## 📈 Key Dashboard Components

### 1. 📌 **Ticket Volume Overview**
- Total tickets logged
- Monthly and weekly trend chart
- Ticket distribution by type (bar chart or pie)

### 2. 🕓 **SLA and Resolution Time**
- % of tickets resolved within SLA
- Average resolution time by priority
- Line chart showing resolution time trends

### 3. 👨‍💻 **Agent Performance**
- Tickets resolved per agent
- Average handling time per agent
- SLA compliance rate by agent

### 4. 🚨 **Priority Breakdown**
- Tickets by priority level
- High-priority vs low-priority ticket count
- Average response/resolution time per priority

### 5. 🏢 **Departmental Analysis**
- Number of tickets per department
- Top 5 departments by ticket volume
- Department-wise resolution trends

## 🧠 Key Insights

- 📌 **High-priority tickets** tend to exceed SLA more often than low-priority ones.
- 🧑‍💻 Some agents resolve tickets significantly faster — indicating training opportunities.
- 🔄 Ticket volume peaks at the beginning of each month — likely due to system updates.
- 🏢 Departments like IT & HR raise the highest number of tickets.
- 🟡 Tickets marked “In Progress” exceed expected resolution window in multiple cases.

## 📊 KPIs Tracked

| KPI                        | Description                                      |
